In this paper, we show that our model outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods in MaxBLEU, personality classification accuracy, coherence score, and BLEU. The human evaluation results are also aligned with that obtained from the automatic metrics. Our model is subjectively considered better in capturing personal characteristics and keeping coherence.","tags":[],"title":"Personalized Dialogue Response Generation Learned from Monologues","type":"publication"}]
